The first steps are to upload the Custom Post Types and the Custom Fields. These are very important. The following two steps will add the custom sections and custom fields you see on the demo site.
For example, the Residential, Commercial, Features, Testimonials, Service Area and Meet Your Plumber/Team sections.
Important!
*Even if you want to change this content, you will need to upload this file to add the custom sections for this theme to work correctly.
4.A) Upload Custom Post Types - top
Now let’s import our custom post types and custom fields. It is important to upload this content first, before any other demo content.
NAVIGATE TO ADMIN MENU > CPT UI > IMPORT/EXPORT
1.	Navigate to your main download folder
2.	Open "Demo Content" folder
3.	Open custom-post-types.txt file

5.	Click on the checkbox under “Import Attachments”
6.	Click “Submit.”
WordPress will then upload the file which may take up to one minute depending on your connection speed.
*If you do not see the pages or posts listed or only see a few, check to see if they are in the “trash” section. There should only be 3 or so posts and about 25 pages.
If your numbers are different, follow these steps:
NAVIGATE TO ADMIN MENU > PAGES > ALL PAGES
1.	Click on the “trash” link
2.	Click on the checkbox next to “Title”

Here you have the option to set the color of the Footer Background and the color of the Footer Text. Make you selections and click on the Save & Publish button at the top of the Customizer Panel.

*You have the ability to add and edit all widgets in the Customizer. However, it is recommended you make the initial setup and changes in the Admin Panel.
6.) Widgets (Sidebars) - top
We have made it super simple for you to add all of the widgets from the demo site onto your site.
NAVIGATE TO ADMIN MENU > TOOLS > WIDGET IMPORTER & EXPORTER

2.	Click on the demo folder and select the file ending in .wie.
3.	Then click Import Widgets

If you don’t want to import all of the widgets, you can setup and manage all of the widget areas on your own. Follow the steps below for detailed instructions.
NAVIGATE TO ADMIN MENU > APPEARANCE > WIDGETS
 
Here we will setup and customize your widgets. All widgets are placed inside a sidebar section on your site. PlumbingPress has customized widget areas in the header above your site’s tagline and contact number as well as 4 distinct areas in the footer. This is of course in addition to the widgetized Sidebars which you have the option of showing on the left or right of pages or hide them altogether with the “No Sidebar” page template.
You will see a section of Available Widgets to the left of the page. You can add many more widgets by activating Jetpack. Jetpack has many widgets available for many different needs.
6.A)  Lightweight Social icons (Header Sidebar) - top
Lightweight Social Icons is a great plugin that is bundled with PlumbingPress. It’s the easiest way to add your social icons without adding unnecessary code to your site which may slow it down.
Click on Lightweight Social Icons under the Available widgets area and then select Header Sidebar then Add Widget.
You will now see all of your options:
 
You can customize the size, background color, text color, hover colors, alignments and more.
Here are the options from the demo site.

•	Text Color: #e9e9e9
•	Hover Color: #777777
•	Text Hover Color: #FFFFFF
•	Open links in new window? Yes.
•	Alignment: Center
Choose your colors and then select your social media outlet, Facebook, Twitter etc. Then you can add your companies URL next to the appropriate option. Make sure to include the http:// before the domain. We recommend not using more than 4 icons due to layout adjustments that will occur.
Make all your changes and click Save.
6.B) Left Sidebar, Right Sidebar, Blog Sidebar, Single Sidebar & Commercial Sidebar - top
You may see widgets already in this section. You can either delete or keep them.
To add a text widget to any of these sidebars, click on the desired widget under available widgets, select the sidebar location and click on Add Widget.
Edit the Widget Details and then click Save,  then close to move onto the next widget.
You can add ordinary text or html in all text widgets.
The Left, Right and Blog sidebars are the main sidebars of your site. The left is shown only when that particular page template is set to the Left Sidebar. Right sidebar is matched to the Right Sidebar template and the Blog Sidebar to all your blog pages and articles. All of these sidebars are added and edited in the same way.
The Commercial Sidebar is only shown on the main Commercial page and not the Commercial Post Pages.
6.C)  Footer Widgets - top
You can add any available widgets to the Footer following the same procedures as above. If you want to add the widgets that are on the demo and make changes from there, follow the upload instructions at the top of this section.
7.) Menus - top
NAVIGATE TO ADMIN MENU > APPEARANCE > MENUS
If you’ve followed the quick start guide and uploaded all of the demo content, you will see several menus already set up, Main Menu, Large Menu, Commercial Menu, Testimonials Menu and Footer Menu.
You can easily update or edit all menus.
1.	Navigate to the Edit Menus Tab
2.	Highlight the menu in the dropdown
3.	Click Select.
You can add pages under the Pages Panel by clicking on the appropriate page and then clicking Add to Menu. You can also add any link under the Custom Link tab. Be sure to add the http:// to the URL and then add your link text and click Add to Menu.
To edit a link inside the Menu Structure, click on the arrow down button to make your changes.
Below the Menu Structure, you can select where you want each menu to be located. Then click Save Menu.
Main Menu
The Main Menu is the Primary navigation on the site, which pops up or overlays the page by clicking on the Menu Icon Image located top right of every page.
Large Menu
The Large Menu is named such because it is only shown on larger screens above 1026 pixels wide. If you’re viewing your site on a phone or tablet chances are you won’t see this screen.
Commercial Menu
This menu doesn't have a specified area. This means you can add this menu via a menu widget and place it anywhere you desire.
Testimonials Menu
This menu also doesn't have a specified area. This means you can add this menu via a menu widget and place it anywhere you desire.
Footer Menu
The Footer Menu is used inside a menu widget that is located in the middle left position of the footer.
8.) Pages - top
If you’ve followed the quick start guide and uploaded the demo content, you will see a fair amount of pages with content.
In WordPress, you can create either posts or Pages. When you're writing a regular blog entry, you write a post. Posts, in a default setup, appear in reverse chronological order on your blog's home page.
Pages are for content such as "About," "Contact," etc. Pages live outside of the normal blog chronology, and are often used to present timeless information about yourself or your site -- information that is always applicable. You can use Pages to organize and manage any content.
In addition to the generally required "About" and "Contact" Pages, other examples of common pages include Copyright, Disclosure, Legal Information, Reprint Permissions, Company Information, and Accessibility Statement.
In general, Pages are very similar to Posts in that they both have Titles and Content and can use your WordPress Theme templates files to maintain a consistent look throughout your site. Pages, though, have several key distinctions that make them quite different from Posts.
What Pages Are:
•	Pages are for content that is less time-dependent than Posts.
•	Pages can be organized into pages andsubpages.
•	Pages can use differentPage Templates which can include Template Files, Template Tags and other PHP code.
•	Pages may have a more complex array of readily available display adjustments when using sophisticated Themes with extensive customization.
•	In essence, Pages are for non-blog content. It is possible to remove all or most Posts from a WordPress installation, and thus to create a standard non-blog website.
What Pages are Not:
•	Pages are not Posts, nor are they excerpted from larger works of fiction. They do not cycle through your blog's main page. WordPress Plugins are available to change the defaults if necessary.
•	Pages cannot be associated with Categories and cannot be assigned Tags. The organizational structure for Pages comes only from their hierarchical interrelationships, and not from Tags or Categories.
•	Pages are not files. They are stored in your database just like Posts are.
•	Although you can put Template Tags and PHP code into a Page Template file, you cannot put these into the Page or Post content without a WordPress Plugin likeExec-PHP which overwrites the code filtering process.
•	Pages are not included in your site's feed.
•	Pages and Posts may attract attention in different ways from humans or search engines.
•	Pages (or a specific post) can be set as astatic front page if desired with a separate Page set for the latest blog posts, typically named "blog."
Creating Pages
NAVIGATE TO ADMIN MENU > PAGES > ADD NEW
 
Here you will see where to add the Title of the page and the Subtitle. (The subtitle is not shown in above screenshot.) The Subtitle is shown below the title on pages with Title Bars.
Directly below the titles you will see the visual and text editor. This is where you add the content of the page.
To view the available Shortcodes, which give you the ability to add buttons, columns, pricing tables and more, you need to click on the Toolbar Toggle icon.
 
Then you will see all of the shortcode options:
 
Refer to the Shortcodes Section for more information on how to use.
You can add images by clicking on the Add Media button on top of the editor.
 
You can add one image or a gallery with the options on the left.
 
In the right column under Page Attributes, you will see a Parent option and a Page Template option
 
The parent attribute isn’t that important and you can leave that set as is. The next option is important. This is where you can choose the layout of your page. You can select a page with a left sidebar, right sidebar, no sidebar and full width pages.
You can also select a featured image that will be shown at the top left of the pages body content.
Click on the Publish button and you’re all set.
9.) Posts - top
Posts are entries that display in reverse order on your home page. Posts usually have comments fields beneath them and are included in your site's RSS feed.
To write a post:
NAVIGATE TO ADMIN MENU > POSTS > ADD NEW
1.	Start filling in the blanks: enter your post title in the upper field, and enter your post body content in the main post editing box below it.
2.	As needed, select a category, add tags, and make other selections from the sections below the post. (Each of these sections is explained below.)
3.	When you are ready, clickPublish.
Screen Options
There are more editing fields available to you than you see on first login. The Screen Options area allows you to choose which Post Fields are displayed or hidden from your editing area, which allows you to minimize clutter and customize according to your needs.
You'll find the Screen Options tab at the very top of your screen, and if you click on it, you'll see a list of available editing boxes that you can use. Check the box for each Post Field you want displayed, or uncheck the box to hide that module. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the tab.
 
Once you've customized how your editing screen works, your options are saved so you don't have to select or hide them again next time you log in.
Descriptions of Post Fields
WordPress Admin Writing Post Advanced Panel - Top of Page
Title/Headline Box
The title of your post. You can use any phrases, words or characters. Avoid using the same title twice as that will cause problems. You can use commas, apostrophes, quotes, hyphens/dashes and other typical symbols in the post like "My Site - Here's Lookin' at You, Kid". WordPress will then clean it up to generate a user-friendly and URL-valid name of the post (also called the "post slug") to compose the permalink for the post.
Body Copy Box
The blank box where you enter your writing, links, links to images, and any information you want to display on your site. You can use either the Visual or the Text view to compose your posts. For more on the Text view, see the section below, Visual Versus Text View.
Preview button
Allows you to view the post before officially publishing it.
Publish box 
Contains buttons that control the state of your post. The main states are Published, Pending Review and Draft. A Published status means the post has been published live on your blog for all to see. Pending Review means the draft is waiting for review by an editor prior to publication. Draft means the post has not been published and remains a draft for you. If you select a specific publish status and click the update post or "Publish" button, that status is applied to the post. For example, to save a post in the Pending Review status, select Pending Review from the Publish Status drop-down box, and click Save As Pending. (You will see all posts organized by status by going to Administration Panels > Posts > Edit). To schedule a post for publication on a future time or date, click "Edit" in the Publish area next to the words "Publish immediately". You can also change the publish date to a date in the past to back-date posts. Change the settings to the desired time and date. You must also hit the "Publish" button when you have completed the post to publish at the desired time and date.
Publish box 
Visibility - This determines how your post appears to the world. Public posts will be visible by all website visitors once published. Password Protected posts are published to all, but visitors must know the password to view the post content. Private posts are visible only to you (and to other editors or admins within your site)
Permalink 
Permalink stands for "permanent link". That means a post URL that does not expose the post ID which could be subject to a change (e.g. when moving to different blogging system), but it rather contains a user-friendly post name derived from the post title which could also change, although not recommended, but in a more controllable way. This post name (also referred to as "post slug" or just "slug") can be edited, depending on your Permalinks settings, using the "Edit" button. (To change your settings, go to Admin Menu > Settings > Permalinks). The permalink is automatically generated based on the title you set to the post and is shown below the title field. Punctuation such as commas, quotes, apostrophes, and invalid URL characters are removed and spaces are substituted with dashes to separate each word. If your title is "My Site - Here's Lookin' at You, Kid", it will be cleaned up to create the slug "my-site-heres-lookin-at-you-kid". You can manually change this, maybe shortening it to "my-site-lookin-at-you-kid".
Save 
Allows you to save your post as a draft / pending review rather than immediately publishing it. To return to your drafts later, visit Posts - Edit in the menu bar, then select your post from the list.
Publish 
Publishes your post on the site. You can edit the time when the post is published by clicking the Edit link above the "Publish" button and specifying the time you want the post to be published. By default, at the time the post is first auto-saved, that will be the date and time of the post within the database.
Post Tags 
Refers to micro-categories for your blog, similar to including index entries for a page. Posts with similar tags are linked together when a user clicks one of the tags. Tags have to be enabled with the right code in your theme for them to appear in your post. Add new tags to the post by typing the tag into the box and clicking "Add".
Categories 
The general topic the post can be classified in. Generally, bloggers have 7-10 categories for their content. Readers can browse specific categories to see all posts in the category. To add a new category, click the "+Add New Category" link in this section. You can manage your categories by going to Administration Panels > Posts > Categories.
Best Practices For Posting
You can say or show the world anything you like on your WordPress site. Here are some tips you need to know to help you write your posts in WordPress.
Practice Accessibility 
To be compliant with web standards for accessibility, be sure to include ALT and TITLE descriptions on links and images to help your users, such as <a title="WordPress Codex" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/">WordPress Codex</a>.
Use Paragraphs 
No one likes to read writing that never pauses for a line break. To break your writing up into paragraphs, use double spaces between your paragraphs. WordPress will automatically detect these and insert <p> HTML paragraph tags into your writing.
Use Headings 
If you are writing long posts, break up the sections by using headings, small titles to highlight a change of subject. In HTML, headings are set by the use of h1, h2, h3, h4, and so on. By default, most WordPress Themes use the first, second, and sometimes third heading levels within the site. You can use h4 to set your own headings. You can use the Heading 4 style from your editing dropdown menu using the Visual Editor, or you can enter your headline manually in the Text Editor by typing:
<h4>Subtitle of Section</h4>. To style the heading, add it to your style.css style sheet file. For more information on styling headings, check out Designing Headings.
Use HTML 
You don't have to use HTML when writing your posts. WordPress will automatically add it to your site, but if you do want control over different elements like boxes, headings, and other additional containers or elements, use HTML.
Spell Check and Proof 
There are spell check Plugins available, but even those can't check for everything. Some serious writers will write their posts in a text with spell check, check all the spelling and proof it thoroughly before copying and pasting into WordPress.
Think before you post 
Ranting on blogs is commonplace today, but take a moment and think about what you are writing. Remember, once it is out there, it can be seen by many and crawled by search engines; and taking things back is harder once it is public. Take a moment to read what you've written before hitting the Publish button. When you are ready, share it with the world.
Write about what you like 
You’ve heard this a thousand times before and it sounds too clichéd, but it is true. If you force yourself to write something that you don’t really enjoy, it will show. Perhaps you might not have a specific theme for writing when you just start, but that’s ok. You’ll become more focused later. Just enjoy the experience and write what you like.
Write frequently 
Write as frequently as you can, but don’t let quantity get in the way of quality. Your viewers come for content, not to spend time reading useless stuff.
Don’t use too much slang 
Not all the readers will be from your part of the world so make sure people can understand easily.
Don't hide your emotions 
Tempting as it might be, don’t hide your real emotions. After all that is what a blog is about. If you want, you can stay anonymous and voice your feelings on whatever you are passionate about. You might have strong views on various subjects but let your readers know your passion. What is passion worth if you can’t even share it? You’ll actually love the discussions it can lead to. The discussions will broaden your own thinking and you might end up making some really good friends.
Consider your readers 
Perhaps this sounds weird, but consider who needs to know about your blog before you tell them about your new blogging hobby. Will you be able to write freely if you tell them? How much should you let your readers know about you? Is it ok if your boss or girlfriend reads your posts? If you don’t want them to read, take anonymity measures accordingly.
Make use of comments 
Comments let people share their ideas. Sometimes, they might not be good, but you can ask such people to shut up. Most of the times, they will and if they don’t you can delete their comments. Blogging like real life, can be both fun and not so fun at times. Be prepared. Also, give your people a place to contact you in private if they want to write to you.
Don’t play too safe 
Talk about the real you. Readers aren’t impressed by how big your house is, which cool club you belong to, or what the weather is in your hometown. Don’t be a bore and put a long post on how you fixed the leaking tap in minutes. Readers don’t care about braggers, they care about the real you--how you feel, what gets you excited, why you are the person you are. But if achievements are all that you can talk about, you will bore your readers.
Use pictures and videos 
They make the pages colorful and viewers get to see a little of your part of the world. They feel connected.
Keep writing 
Don’t stop blogging. If you don’t have anything to write about, chances are, you are still holding back. Let loose. Perhaps surf more blogs and maybe you’ll get an idea. You can write about your friends, complain about your boss, or simply rant about what’s gone wrong. Yet if nothing else works, just write a review on the latest movie, book, or product. Easy actually.
Save your posts 
Save your posts before you press the publish button. Anything can happen with your computer or with an internet connection. You don’t need to lose your post.
Visual versus Text Editor
When writing your post, you have the option of using the Visual or Text mode of the editor. The visual mode lets you see your post as is, while the Text mode shows you the code and replaces the WYSIWYG editor buttons with quick tags. These quick tags are explained as follows.
•	b- <strong></strong> HTML tag for strong emphasis of text (i.e. bold).
•	i- <em></em> HTML tag for emphasis of text (i.e. italicize).
•	b-quote - <blockquote></blockquote> HTML tag to distinguish quoted or cited text.
•	del - <del></del> HTML tag to label text considered deleted from a post. Most browsers display asstriked through text.
•	link - <a href="http://example.com"></a> HTML tag to create a hyperlink.
•	ins - <ins></ins> HTML tag to label text considered inserted into a post. Most browsers display asunderlined text.
•	ul - <ul></ul> HTML tag will insert an unordered list, or wrap the selected text in same. An unordered list will typically be a bulleted list of items.
•	ol - <ol></ol> HTML tag will insert a numbered list, or wrap the selected text in same. Each item in an ordered list is typically numbered.
•	li - <li></li> HTML tag will insert or make the selected text a list item. Used in conjunction with the ul or ol tag.
•	code - <code></code> HTML tag for preformatted styling of text. Generally sets text in amonospaced font, such as Courier.
•	more - <!--more--> WordPress tag that breaks a post into "teaser" and content sections. Type a few paragraphs, insert this tag, then compose the rest of your post. On your blog's home page you'll see only those first paragraphs with a hyperlink ((more...)), which when followed displays the rest of the post's content.
•	page - <!--nextpage--> WordPress tag similar to themore tag, except it can be used any number of times in a post, and each insert will "break" and paginate the post at that location. Hyperlinks to the paginated sections of the post are then generated in combination with the wp_link_pages() or link_pages() template tag.
•	lookup - Opens a JavaScript dialogue box that prompts for a word to search for through the online dictionary at answers.com. You can use this to check spelling on individual words.
•	Close Tags - Closes any open HTML tags left open--but pay attention to the closing tags. WordPress is not a mind reader (!), so make sure the tags enclose what you want, and in the proper way.
Workflow Note
With Quick tag buttons that insert HTML tags, you can for example click i to insert the opening <em> tag, type the text to be enclosed, and click /i or Close Tags to insert the closing tag. However, you can eliminate the need for this 'close' step by changing your workflow a bit: type your text, select the portion to be emphasized (that is, italicized), then click i and your highlighted text will be wrapped in the opening and closing tags.
10.) Shortcodes - top
Shortcodes drastically enhance your ability add dynamic web elements to your posts and pages. By clicking on the Toggle Toolbar:
 
You will see all of your capabilities your Shortcodes toolbar offers.
 
These shortcodes are powered by a highly recognized and rated plugin called Easy Foundation Shortcode. The shortcode generated is powered by one of the most widely used CSS design frameworks called Foundation.
When you hover over the icons with your cursor, you will see the name and function of each shortcode.
 
Let’s give this a try and add an Icon Heading to a page.
Click on the “Icon Heading” located here:
 
Select your Icon from the dropdown menu, and then choose your heading type. This is actually the size of the heading. H1 is the biggest, H6 is the smallest. Most of the main headings on the demo site use the H2 size to give you some reference.
Then add you’re heading text and include any custom CSS you may have. This can be left blank.
Click on “Insert Icon Heading” and it will automatically be added to your page or post.
 
All of the other shortcodes are added in the same general way. You can also edit your text after the shortcode has been placed inside the editor. In the above example, you can change the “heading type from “H2” to “H3” or change the actual heading text.
11.) Residential Plumbing Section - top
The Residential Plumbing section is where you can add or edit all of the services you offer to residential clients. If you have uploaded the demo content, you can click on the “Residential Plumbing” tab and you will see a list of prepopulated services.
 
Click on the Showers & Tubs post and we can go through all available options.
 
Title Field
The first field is of course the title of the post, feel free to edit any of the content inside these posts to suit your specific needs. Doing so will not interrupt the functionality of the site.
Description Field
The second field is the Description field. If you read the post and pages section of this documentation, you will know how to add and edit this content. You may add text, images or video.
Image Field
The image field is the primary image of your post. The recommended image width is under 650 pixels. However, the image will resize itself to the available area on the page.
Featured Image
The featured image located in the right box, is where you want an icon or a thumbnail size image. All of the prepopulated residential posts have a custom pluming icon included. You can leave these blank but they won’t look quite as good on the front page and main residential page.
The above residential fields show up in three different areas, the front page, the main residential page and the actual residential post page.
This is the front page and main residential page.
 
This is the single residential post page.
 
Once you’re finished making any changes, make sure to select Publish or Update to save your work.

If you uploaded the demo content, you will see a prepopulated list of features.
 
The features fields are located on the front page and the about us page. And should look like this:
 
Click on “Full Service Solution” and you will see this is a simple post. It only has the title, which is for your clarification and not a part of the actual post and the Feature field. The icon and heading is created by the shortcode “Icon Heading.”
 
Select your Icon from the dropdown menu, and then choose your heading type. This is actually the size of the heading. This section requires the heading size or type of H4. This is important for styling.
Then add the heading text and you leave the CSS field blank.
Click on “Insert Icon Heading” and it will automatically be added to your page or post.
 
You can add as many features as you like but keep in mind that a longer list will increase the height of this section on the front page and the about us page.
Make sure to select Publish or Update to save your changes.
14.) Testimonials - top
The testimonials section contains posts that are shown on the front page, about us page and the main testimonials page. The front page is set to show 2 testimonials, about us page is set to 4 and the main testimonial page will show all available testimonials.

20.) HTML Structure - top
PlumbingPress was written in HTML5. Each page draws in the Header and Footer files with the code below.
<?php get_header(); ?> (Shown at the top of the page)
<?php get_footer(); ?> (Shown at the bottom of the page)
All of the body content of each page is inside a div of content-wrapper which looks like this:
<div class="content-wrapper row">
Inside the content-wrapper, you will first see the Page Title Bar Section which will look like this:
<!-- Page Title Bar -->
<div class="title-bar">
<div class="title-bar-header small-8 large-10 columns">
<h2><?php the_title(); ?></h2>
<hr>
<blockquote class="show-for-medium-up">
<q><?php the_field('subtitle'); ?><q>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="title-bar-icon-wrapper small-4 large-2 columns">
<i class="fi-mail"></i>
</div>
</div> <!-- .title-bar -->
After the Page Title Bar section the main div’s for the body content will follow. PlumbingPress includes page templates with a left sidebar, right sidebar, no sidebar and full width pages.
The layout for any page with a sidebar will start with a Two Column section:
<!-- Two Column Section -->
<section class="two-column">
Followed by the Primary Column:
<!-- Primary Column -->
<div class="primary small-12 medium-8 medium-push-4 columns">
The Primary Column is where your post and page content reside. You will often see the WordPress loop (which is the body content of the page you create in the WordPress Admin) as follows:
<?php if ( have_posts() ) : while ( have_posts() ) : the_post(); ?>
<p><?php the_content(); ?></p>
<?php endwhile; else : ?>
<p><?php _e( 'Sorry, no pages found.', 'PlumbingPress' ); ?></p>
<?php endif; ?>
All of the elements (divs, sections, asides, etc.) will end with the class name of the element “commented out” to the right as follows:
</div> <!-- .primary -->
The characters next to “.primary” are meant to give the code clarity and is not shown on the front end of the site.
After the Primary Column you will come to the Secondary Column which retains secondary content such as the sidebar.
<!-- Secondary Column -->
<?php get_sidebar('right'); ?>
The Secondary Column is also used in pages starting with “single-“, as in single-residential, single-team, etc.
In these pages, the main image resides in the Primary Column and the post content resides in the Secondary Column. This is done to make the code lighter and more semantic so the image will show on top of the post content when viewed on smaller screens.
Next you will see the Prefooter Section which is shown right above the main footer and houses your logo, site tagline and phone number.
<!-- Prefooter Section -->
<div class="small-12 columns">
<?php get_template_part('content', 'prefooter'); ?>
</div>
This section is just another call to action area to get the visitor to make contact.
After the Prefooter you will see the main content-wrapper end…
</div> <!-- .content-wrapper -->
All of the custom page templates follow this general layout. For the No-Sidebar template, you won’t see the Two-Column or Secondary Columns since it’s just one column (Primary Column) without the sidebar.
21.) PHP Code - top
PlumbingPress follows all web standards set forth by WordPress and ThemeForest. The most important thing to understand about the PHP structure of this theme is that it utilizes Custom Post Types and Custom Fields.
The Custom Post Types were created with the Custom Post Types UI plugin. They are not hard coded into the theme so you have the ability to keep and utilize your custom posts if you switch themes.
The Custom Post Types are located in the WordPress Admin menu:
•	Residential
•	Commercial
•	Features
•	Testimonials
•	Click to Call
•	Service Areas
•	Meet your Plumber
To utilize the Custom Posts, you need Custom Fields. The custom fields were created with the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. To show the content of the custom fields on the front end of the site we utilize the get_field() function.
Here’s an example:
<?php the_field('image'); ?>
This function pulls the image from the custom field of the post. This function is the most widely used in the theme and is used on multiple pages and template parts.
List of Advanced Custom Fields Used in Theme:
•	<?php the_field('image'); ?>
•	<?php the_field('description'); ?>
•	<?php the_field('position'); ?>
•	<?php the_field('facebook_url'); ?
•	<?php the_field('twitter_url'); ?>
•	<?php the_field('email'); ?>
•	<?php the_field('phone_number'); ?>
•	<?php the_field('number'); ?>
•	<?php the_field('color'); ?>
•	<?php the_field('text'); ?>
•	<?php the_field('feature'); ?>
•	<?php the_field("town-1"); ?><
•	<?php the_field("testimonial"); ?>
•	<?php the_field("location"); ?>
All of the above functions draw all of the content from the Residential, Commercial, Features, Testimonials, Click to Call, Service Areas and the Meet your Plumber Post Types from the WordPress Admin Menu.
To Edit these values, refer to the Custom Post Sections above.
22.) Template Parts - top
PlumbingPress utilizes several template parts. Most of the main template parts are a part of a 3 file group. These consist of the page template (page-), content page (content-), and single page (single-).
Let’s look at an example for the Residential Posts.
1.	content-residential.php - This page holds the values of the custom fields
2.	page-residential.php - The page template which retrieves content-residential.php
3.	single-residential.php – This page shows a single post.
23.) CSS - top
PlumbingPress utilizes 6 separate CSS files. The most important of course is the style.css. This is the main file that sets out the design of the entire site. Style.css resides in the main folder of the theme. The rest of the CSS files are in the CSS folder.
Here is a list of the CSS Files
•	css
•	min.css
•	css (there for backup)
•	css (not utilized by default, un-comment in functions.php to load)
•	carousel.css
•	theme.css
•	transitions.css
PlumbingPress was built upon the Foundation 5 CSS Framework. This greatly enhances the usability and customizing capabilities of the theme. This also allows the easy inclusion of the EFS Shortcodes plugin. PlumbingPress has custom coded elements that are utilized when the shortcodes are added. This is akin to having a custom designed shortcode plugin.
Both the EFS Shortcodes Plugin and the theme itself allow the use of custom CSS. You can check out the Foundation 5 Framework documentation in the two links below.
Foundation Documentation

Foundation Cheatsheat
http://sudheerdev.github.io/Foundation5CheatSheet/
24.) JavaScript - top
PlumbingPress uses JavaScript built from JQuery 1.9.1. JavaScript takes care of the following functions:
•	Primary Navigation
•	Customizer
•	Google Maps via Advanced Custom Fields Plugin
•	Waypoints
•	Skip Link Focus
•	Modernizer
•	Owl Carousel
•	Foundation 5
Here is a list of the JavaScript Files
•	js – Primary Navigation
•	js – Owl Carousel Functions
•	js – Live Preview Customizer Functions
•	accordion.js – As used in FAQ in demo
•	min.js – Main Minified Foundation File
•	tooltip.js
•	Google-maps.js – Map as shown in Service Area
•	waypoints.min.js
•	Jquery-1.9.1.min.js – Main Minified JavaScript File
•	js
•	js
•	carousel.min.js
•	Skip-link-focus-fix.js
25.) Fonts - top
PlumbingPress utilizes 3 fonts from Google Fonts.
1.	Asap
2.	Montserrat
3.	Raleway
Montserrat is used for most of the page headlines and menus. If the element has a <h1-6> tag, most likely it’s using the Montserrat font.
Asap is used for the main body content text and is pulled by the <p> tag.
Raleway is only used for the Testimonial text.
All three of these fonts are loaded to the theme via the following line of code in the functions.php file.
wp_enqueue_style( 'googlefont_css', 'http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Asap:400,700|Montserrat:400,700|Raleway:300,500');
PlumbingPress also used Icon Fonts from FontAwesome and Foundation Icons.
These icons are very easy to use, all you have to do is go to the icon list and copy and paste the code shown for your desired icon.
Here are the links to use both icon fonts.
FontAwesome
https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/
Foundation Icons
http://zurb.com/playground/foundation-icon-fonts-3
26.) Languages - top
PlumbingPress is ready to be translated into your language.  The Pot file is located in the languages folder. The easiest way to translate the site is to use the WPML plugin. If you don’t want to us WPML, you can translate the theme manually using POEDIT.
Here are the links to translate via the above methods.
